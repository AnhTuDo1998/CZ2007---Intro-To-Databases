# CZ2007---Intro-To-Databases

This lab is to introduce students to the standard procedures behind building a Relational Database Management System. At the beginning of the semester, lab groups are formed and each group are assigned a project description with breakdown of tasks to complete throughout the semester. Result should be a complete RDMS running in T-SQL/MSSQL. 

Last lab session is a demo/assessment session. The tutor/TA will examine the built databse by each group and ask question relating to the database to assess the design practices, approaches taken by each team.
